kanaedit is a simple editor for katakana and hiragana. You can type in standard romaji (english representations of kana characters) and it will "translate" what you type on the fly.

The top box is the input field--where input text is displayed, and the lower box is the output field--where the processed kana is displayed. In the top left is an options menu, where you can...

- Switch between Katakana mode and Hiragana mode
- Clear the screen (both text fields)
- Save what is in the output field to a unicode text file
- Exit the program

The program uses SFML as a display interface. Future updates may make use of SFML's other features, such as sound or networking. kanaedit currently builds on Windows, Linux, and {Free|Open}BSD.

# Simple kana editor
kana-edit is a simple editor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">katakana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">hiragana</a>. You can type in standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8Dmaji">romaji</a> (english representations of kana characters) and it will "translate" what you type *on the fly*.

The top box is the input field--where input text is displayed, and the lower box is the output field--where the processed kana is displayed. In the top left is an options menu, where you can...

- Switch between Katakana mode and Hiragana mode
- Clear the screen (both text fields)
- Save what is in the output field to a unicode text file
- Exit the program

The program uses <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> as a display interface. Future updates may make use of SFML's other features, such as sound or networking.

# Dependencies
Here's a list of what you'll need to build kana-edit:
- sfml-dev >=2.0
- g++
- GNU make

Some linux machines don't come with unicode support, so make sure your system can display characters within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana_%28Unicode_block%29">hiragana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana_%28Unicode_block%29">katakana</a> blocks.

# Build kana-edit
To build kana-edit, make sure you have a fresh clone.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dseguin/kana-edit.git
```
Then change to the build directory.
```
$ cd kana-edit/build
```
There are two scripts to run. The first attempts to change define macros in include/defines.h to suit the machine that builds it. The second is a configure script generated by GNU autotools.
```
$ ../autodefine.sh
$ ../configure
```
And now to make and run the program.
```
$ make
$ src/kanaedit
```

# Troubleshooting
The most common problem relates to the define paths in <a href="include/defines.h">include/defines.h</a>. The autodefine.sh will handle this in most cases, but it may be necessary to adjust these yourself.
- FONT\_ARIAL : This defines the path to resources/arial.ttf
- FONT\_MANGAL : This defines the path to resources/mangal.ttf
- DEFAULT\_SAVE\_PATH : This defines the folder where documents are saved by default
- MKDIR\_PATH : This defines the path to the mkdir executable (run 'whereis mkdir' to find it)

These should be absolute paths to guarantee that the program will run from any working directory.

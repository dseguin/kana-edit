# Simple kana editor
kana-edit is a simple editor for katakana and hiragana. You can type in standard romanji (english representations of kana characters) and it will "translate" what you type *on the fly*.

The top box is the input field--where input text is displayed, and the lower box is the output field--where the processed kana is displayed. In the top left is an options menu, where you can...

- Switch between Katakana mode and Hiragana mode
- Clear the screen (both text fields)
- Save what is in the output field to a unicode text file
- Exit the program

The program uses SFML as a display interface. Future updates may make use of SFML's other features, such as sound or networking.
